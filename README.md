# 🎮 Blaire: Math Game for the Blind  

**Hear the numbers, play the math.**  

Blaire is an **audio-based mathematics game** built for the blind and visually impaired.  
It transforms learning into an inclusive, engaging experience by using **sound cues, voice interaction, and adaptive challenges**.  

---

## 🚀 Elevator Pitch  
Blaire makes math fun and accessible for the blind through audio-driven gameplay, speech recognition, and sound-based navigation.  

---

## 🌟 Inspiration  
Most math games rely heavily on visuals, leaving visually impaired learners behind.  
We wanted to **reimagine mathematics** as an *auditory journey*, making every problem, choice, and challenge accessible through sound.  

---

## 📚 What We Learned  
- Accessibility must be **built from the ground up**.  
- Audio and haptics can create **immersive experiences** without visuals.  
- Speech recognition must be **adaptable to diverse voices and accents**.  
- Designing for inclusivity makes us rethink **traditional game mechanics**.  

---

## 🛠️ How We Built It  
- **Platform:** Flutter for cross-platform development (Android/iOS/Web).  
- **Interaction:** Voice-based navigation, audio cues, and haptic feedback.  
- **Math Engine:** Dynamic generation of arithmetic problems with adaptive difficulty.  
- **Audio Design:** Sound cues recorded and refined with Audacity.  
- **Accessibility:** Integrated TalkBack (Android) and VoiceOver (iOS).  

Example math narration:  

Instead of showing  
\[
7 \times 3 = ?
\]  
Blaire asks: *“What is seven times three?”* and waits for a spoken answer.  

---

## ⚔️ Challenges  
- Creating a **fully non-visual interface** while keeping it fun.  
- Handling noisy environments for speech recognition.  
- Balancing **gameplay design** with **mathematical rigor**.  
- Designing audio cues that are **clear but not overwhelming**.  

---

## 🔮 Future Vision  
We plan to expand Blaire into:  
- Algebra and Geometry (narrated & sound-based).  
- Multiplayer “Math Battles” with audio-only interaction.  
- Offline play with enhanced **text-to-speech integration**.  

---

## 🏗️ Built With  
- **Languages:** Dart (Flutter), Python (prototyping math engine)  
- **Frameworks:** Flutter, TensorFlow Lite  
- **Platforms:** Android, iOS, Web  
- **APIs:** Google Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech  
- **Cloud:** Firebase, Google Cloud  
- **Databases:** Firebase Realtime DB, SQLite (offline storage)  
- **Accessibility Tools:** TalkBack, VoiceOver, Haptic feedback  
- **Other Tools:** GitHub, Figma, Audacity
